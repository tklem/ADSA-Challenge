# ADSA-Challenge
This repository contains all of the files used in the ADSA Novice Datathon Challenge. The task was to identify whether a website would be deemed relevant to its users after a long period of time. The code used to develop a classifier is contained in the iPython notebooks attached. The general approach was to train a Random Forest classifier using the quantitative categories in the website data. Each category is weighted by its correlation cofficient with the popularity of the website (1-popular, 0-not) so that categories more related to popularity would influence the classifier more heavily.
